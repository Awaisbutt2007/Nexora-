/* Dev/preview API proxy. The frontend talks to the backend through THIS server
   (relative /api and /uploads URLs — see API_BASE in src/api/nexora.js), so every
   request is same-origin and CORS cannot fail. That kills a whole class of
   "Failed to fetch" traps: Vite rolling to :5174/:5175 when a port is busy, opening
   the app through the printed Network URL (http://192.168.x.x:5173) or from a phone,
   and localhost vs 127.0.0.1 mismatches. A production build stays same-origin as well,
   because the backend serves dist/ itself. Point VITE_API_URL somewhere else only to
   bypass the proxy (e.g. a deployed backend). The default is the IPv4 LITERAL, not
   `localhost`: the backend binds `0.0.0.0` (IPv4 only — it never answers on `::1`), while
   Node resolves `localhost` to `::1` FIRST. When that first hop is refused or dropped the
   proxy surfaces it to the browser as a bare `Chat failed (502)` with no JSON body — the
   exact intermittent Windows failure a direct 127.0.0.1 test can never reproduce. */
