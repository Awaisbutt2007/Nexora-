# DEPLOYMENT.md — Nexora / Aira

Setup, production configuration, and a rollback plan. This is a **runbook**, not
an executed deploy — no deployment, publish, or paid usage was performed here
(that needs explicit approval, see `NEXT_STEPS.md`).

## Components & default ports
| Piece | Dir | Dev port | Run |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend (Vite) | repo root | 5173 | `npm run dev` |
| Backend (Express + SQLite) | `backend/` | **8787** | `npm --prefix backend start` (`dev` = watch) |
| Desktop agent (optional, local) | `desktop-agent/` | **8799** | `npm --prefix desktop-agent start` — loopback only |

The desktop agent is **optional** and must stay on the same machine as the
backend (127.0.0.1). It fails closed if no shared secret is configured.

## 1. Local setup
```bash
npm install
npm --prefix backend install
npm --prefix desktop-agent install        # only if using the desktop agent

cp .env.example .env                       # frontend: VITE_API_URL, VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env       # backend secrets (never committed)
# (optional) cp desktop-agent/.env.example desktop-agent/.env

npm run dev:api &                          # backend on :8787
npm run dev                                # frontend on :5173
```
Mock mode works with **no** provider keys (chat/tools/credits run against a
deterministic mock). Realtime voice and real model answers need `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## 2. Production environment (backend)
Set in the host's secret manager (never in git):

| Var | Requirement |
|---|---|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` — enables the fail-fast guards + HSTS + error redaction |
| `JWT_SECRET` | **≥ 32 chars, random**. Generate: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"`. The app **refuses to boot** on a missing/default/short secret. |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | The real frontend origin(s), comma-separated. **Must not** be localhost (boot fails otherwise). |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_MODEL` | Real provider for live answers; leave key empty → mock. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | To enable Google Sign-In (audience is verified server-side). |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `true` **only** behind a reverse proxy/LB, so the rate limiter sees real client IPs. |
| `DB_PATH` | Absolute, writable, **backed-up** path for the SQLite file. |
| `DESKTOP_AGENT_URL` / `DESKTOP_AGENT_SECRET` | Only if using the agent; URL must be loopback. |
| `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT`, `AI_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN`, `VOICE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_10MIN` | Tune abuse limits. |

The frontend build only ever inlines `VITE_*` values (public). Confirm no backend
secret has a `VITE_` prefix.

## 3. Build & serve
```bash
npm run build                       # -> dist/ (static; host on a CDN or any static server)
npm --prefix backend start          # API on :8787 (put behind nginx/caddy or a PaaS)
```
- Serve `dist/` over **HTTPS** only.
- Point the frontend's `VITE_API_URL` at the public API origin, and allow that same
  origin in backend `CORS_ORIGIN`.
- Put TLS termination + HSTS at the proxy (HSTS is also emitted by the app in prod).
- Install from lockfiles (`npm ci`) in CI deploys for reproducibility.

## 4. Pre-deploy gate (must be green)
```bash
npm run security:check:full   # secrets + tracked-file guard, incl. Git history
npm run build && npm run lint
npm test && npm run test:agent
npm run audit:all
```

## 5. Database, backups & migration notes
- Engine: **SQLite** (`node:sqlite`), single file at `DB_PATH`
  (default `backend/data/nexora.db`, WAL mode — back up the `-wal`/`-shm` too or
  checkpoint first). Schema is created in code (`backend/src/db/index.js`);
  there is **no automated migration runner yet** (see `NEXT_STEPS.md` P2-11).
- **Back up before every deploy**:
  ```bash
  sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" ".backup 'backup-$(date +%F-%H%M).db'"   # safe online copy
  ```
- Account deletion / retention jobs are not automated yet — document the manual
  steps until P2-12 lands.
- If a **multi-instance** deploy is required, SQLite (single writable node) is the
  bottleneck; plan a tested Postgres migration rather than running multiple writers.

## 6. Rollback
1. Stop the new release; redeploy the previous build artifact + previous
   `backend/` code (env secrets are unchanged).
2. If the DB was touched, restore the pre-deploy `*.backup` file to `DB_PATH`.
3. `npm --prefix backend start` on the prior version; verify `/health` and a mock
   chat round-trip.
4. Because deploys are additive and the app fails fast on bad prod env, a failed
   boot leaves the previous instance safe to re-enable.

## 7. What is NOT yet ready for production
- No deployment manifest/IaC chosen yet (container/PaaS config still to be authored).
- `/health` answers with readiness only; never set `HEALTH_VERBOSE=1` in a public
  deployment (it puts the engine and voice model ids back into that public response).
- No metrics/alerting; provider timeouts on AI calls are default (`NEXT_STEPS.md` P0-3).
- Realtime voice / Google Sign-In / image gen are unverified without live keys.
